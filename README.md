***Note***

Bonnie Alba Motorcycle Tours is my very first website created as a part of User Centric Front-End Development. It is my Milestone 1 project and confirmation of my coding skills I had gained since started the Full-Stack Web Developer course provided by Code Institute. 

***Demo*** 

The website live demo can be found here 

***UX***

1.	My goal:

    •	creating a website about visiting Scotland on motorcycle;

2.	Potential website user:

    •	motorcycle enthusiasts who would like to experience challenging but stunning roads in Scotland;
    
    •	people interested in visiting Scotland and looking for information about places worth to see;

3.	Website functionality:

    •	user-friendly and easy to navigate;
    
    •	providing the potential website user with information they require when planning a motorcycle trip to Scotland;
    
    •	giving an opportunity to purchase motorcycle gear and contact directly the website owner if more information is required;

***Wireframes***

I have used Balsamiq to create wireframe mockups to represent the project’s structure and the way the project would look like.

***Features***

All pages consist a responsive navigation bar with a logo (motorcycle related icon) located in right-top corner. When
users click on the logo it will return them to the home page. Each page has a different background-image and an active button which 
once tapped will transfer the user to Polish version of the website. The footer has a copyright information and social media icons which will link
the user to the website owner social media pages (the size and color of social media icons will change when using a hover function).


***Technologies Used***

The following technologies have been used in the project completion process:
	HTML5 which defines the properties and behaviours of web page content  
	CSS which describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen 
	BootstrapCDN v4.3.1 to make the website responsive and user-friendly
	Font Awesome v4.7.0 to control the way the icon looks  
	Google Fonts responsible for styling the website fonts 
	jQuery v3.4.1 to standardize and simplify interactions between HTML elements and JavaScript code
	Popper.js to calculate the position of an element and required for the responsive navbar

***Project Testing***

More information about the project testing can be found in 
<a href=”https://github.com/KrisK1978/milestone-project1-bamt-ucfd/blob/master/TESTING.md”>

***Deployment***

The website is hosted using GitHub pages and can be deployed directly from the <a href=”https://github.com/KrisK1978/milestone-project1-bamt-ucfd”>master branch   Initially the project was developed using the <a href=”https://c9.io/login”> Cloud9 IDE but due to a long-planned platform upgrade it had been migrated to a new Amazon Website Services account.
