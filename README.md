***Note***

Bonnie Alba Motorcycle Tours is my very first website created as a part of User Centric Front-End Development. It is my Milestone 1 project and confirmation of my coding skills I had gained since started the Full-Stack Web Developer course provided by Code Institute. 

***Demo*** 

The website live demo can be found here 

***UX***

1.	My goal:

    •	creating a website about Scotland and interesting places to visit on a motorcycle;

2.	Potential website user:

    •	motorcycle enthusiasts who would like to experience challenging but stunning roads in Scotland;
    
    •	people interested in visiting Scotland and looking for information about places worth to see;
    
    •   English or Polish speaking;

3.	Website functionality:

    •	user-friendly and easy to navigate;
    
    •	providing the potential website user with information they require when planning a motorcycle trip to Scotland;
    
    •	giving an opportunity to purchase motorcycle gear and contact directly the website owner if more information is required;


***Wireframes***

I have used Balsamiq to create wireframe mockups to represent the project’s structure and the way the website would look like.

***Features***

All pages consist a responsive navigation bar with a logo (motorcycle related icon) located in right-top corner. When
users click on the logo it will return them to the home page. Each page has a different background-image and an active button which 
once tapped will transfer the user to Polish version of the website. This will give the non-English speaker users an opportunity to 
access information in their native language. The footer has a copyright information and social media icons which will link the user 
to the website owner social media pages (the size and color of social media icons will change when using a hover function).


**Home Page**

The Home Page features a motorcycle-related image (background) which was converted to grayscale to grab attention and to build 
a nice connection with the website users.
There is also an active 'Sign Up!' button applied on the Home Page. It is a modal's element and when clicked it will provide the user
with additional information i.e. a chance to receive 10% voucher to be used in the Shop section.


**About Us... Page**

The About Us... Page has paragraphs added which contain a brief description of Scotland and interesting places to visit.


**Tours Guide**

The Tours Guide gives the user an opportunity to access the following information:

•   tour destination and duration;

•   tour description;

•   places worth to visit;

•   tour map (the map extends when clicked, it opens in a new window and has interesting places marked);


***Gallery***

The Gallery Page consists a number of images laid out in columns. The number of columns depend on the type of the device. 
Each photo has a caption and can be clicked to open in a modal window. The user can view the content in a bigger size and 
the image can be closed by using 'X' sign. The image has a grayscale filter applied and the scale changes when using a hover function.

***Shop***

The Shop Page gives the user an opportunity to purchase a range of motorcycle products. I used a 'card' component to create the Shop section.
Each card has the following elements: 

•   product image (each image will extend its size when clicked, modal function applied);

•   product title;

•   product price;

•   product description;

•   'Add to Cart' & 'Remove from Cart' buttons (the button's background changes when using a hover function);



***Features to Implement in future***



***Technologies Used***

The following technologies have been used in the project completion process:

•   HTML5 which defines the properties and behaviours of web page content  

•   CSS which describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen 

•   BootstrapCDN v4.3.1 to make the website responsive and user-friendly

•   Font Awesome v4.7.0 to control the way the icon looks  

•   Google Fonts responsible for styling the website fonts 

•   jQuery v3.4.1 to standardize and simplify interactions between HTML elements and JavaScript code

•   Popper.js to calculate the position of an element and required for the responsive navbar


***Project Testing***

More information about the project testing can be found in 



***Deployment***

The website is hosted using GitHub pages and can be deployed directly from the <a href=”https://github.com/KrisK1978/milestone-project1-bamt-ucfd”>master branch</a>
Initially the project was developed using the <a href=”https://c9.io/login”>Cloud9</a> IDE but due to a long-planned platform upgrade it had been migrated to a new Amazon Website Services account.
